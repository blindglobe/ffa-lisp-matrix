Note: as of July 2008, I have split the part of the FFA package that does
not use CFFI into a separate package, ARRAY-OPERATIONS.

Loading FFA will automatically load ARRAY-OPERATIONS, but if you are
importing array manipulating functions into the namespace of your package,
you need to use ARRAY-OPERATIONS too.
